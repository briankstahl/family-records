            <summary><strong>The Founding of the Stahl Book of World Records (SBWR)</strong></summary>
            <p>Since time immemorial, the Stahl family has been renowned for its competitive spirit and a deep-seated belief that every member possesses a unique, record-breaking talent. The founding of the SBWR was not a single event, but rather the culmination of decades worth of experiences starting with the eldest brother Matthew (b.1969) and respectively continuing with brothers Brian (b.1973) then Keith(b.1976).</p>
            <p>At some point in time, after trying to impress each other by sharing legends of various feats, far travels, and questionable escapades, the three original "Founding Fathers"—Matthew, Brian, and Keith—came to a consensus. They realized that some of their individual claims, while impressive, either lacked official ironclad verification, or were not worthy of record status. To bring order to the chaos and finally settle these disputes, they established the Supreme Council of the Stahls (SCS).</p>
            <p>The primary mission of the SCS is to act as the sole arbiters of all record claims, maintaining the integrity, fairness, and worthiness of the SBWR. The Council’s decisions are final, unappealable, and, most importantly, for the good of the family.</p>

            <summary><strong>SBWR Official By-Laws</strong></summary>
            <p><strong>Article 1: Membership and Eligibility</strong></p>
            <p>1.1: <strong>The Stahl Bloodline:</strong> Whether you are a direct descendant of the Stahl lineage or have been welcomed into the family by marriage, you are officially recognized as a member of the Stahl family. This honor grants you the right to submit a request for a record.</p>
            <p>1.2: <strong>Past and Future Generations:</strong> While the SBWR was originally created to encompass the three brothers, it has been decreed that individuals from previous Stahl generations may be considered for inclusion by a majority vote from the SCS. Future generations of Stahls, however, are automatically granted membership and the right to submit records by default.</p>
            <p>1.3: <strong>Claim of Membership:</strong> The SCS is responsible for maintaining and verifying all membership claims to ensure the purity of the record book. Any disputes over family ties must be submitted to the SCS for a final ruling.</p>

            <p><strong>Article 2: Submission and Worthiness of Records</strong></p>
            <p>2.1: <strong>The Submission Process:</strong> All record claims must be submitted to the SCS via the official online portal. Submissions must include all relevant evidence (photos, videos, witness statements, etc.) as detailed in the submission guidelines.</p>
            <p>2.2: <strong>Worthiness and Review:</strong> The Supreme Council of the Stahls (SCS), comprised of the three Stahl brothers (Matthew, Brian, and Keith), will be responsible for reviewing and voting on the worthiness of all record requests. The Council will ensure that all submissions meet the strict standards of integrity, fairness, and, above all, humor.</p>

            <p><strong>Article 3: Nullification of Records</strong></p>
            <p>3.1: <strong>The Grandfather Clause:</strong> It is hereby established that the SCS reserves the right, in perpetuity, to review and, by unanimous vote, render any record null and void.</p>
            <p>3.2: <strong>Grounds for Nullification:</strong> A record may be subject to review and nullification for any of the following reasons, though the SCS's authority is not limited to them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deception or Fraudulent Action: Any use of deceit, falsification of evidence, or other dishonest acts in the submission or achievement of a record.</li>
                <li>Acts of "Douchebagery": Behavior deemed by the SCS to be in violation of the spirit of good sportsmanship, family unity, or common decency, including but not limited to being a complete and utter "douchebag", either in word or deed.</li>
                <li>Changes in Family Status: The severing of familial ties through formal or informal means, such as divorce, may lead to a re-evaluation and potential nullification of any records held by the individual in question.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>3.3: <strong>Final Authority:</strong> The judgment of the SCS in all matters of nullification is final and binding. Any and all records, regardless of their standing or fame, may be expunged from the SBWR at the Council's discretion. The integrity of the records is paramount to the well-being and honor of the Stahl family.</p>

            <summary><strong>Official Rules & Submission Process</strong></summary>
            <p><strong>1. General Principles</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Spirit of the Records:</strong> All records must be based on a spirit of fun, good sportsmanship, and celebrating the unique talents and quirks of family members.</p>
            <p><strong>Originality:</strong> All submitted records must be unique and verifiable within the family context.</p>
            <p><strong>Fair Play:</strong> Any attempt to falsify a record or cheat will result in a disqualification.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Submission Guidelines</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Who Can Submit:</strong> Any family member can submit a record on behalf of themselves or another family member.</p>
            <p><strong>Record Title:</strong> Each submission must have a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Fastest Time in/to (event)" or "Most (statement of feat)”).</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> A detailed description of the record must be included, clearly defining the achievement and any specific rules (e.g., "The record for 'Most Unique Sock Pairings' is measured by the number of different, non-matching socks worn simultaneously.").</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Submissions must include verifiable evidence. This can be in the form of a photo, a video, a written statement from a witness, or a combination of these. The evidence must be clearly dated.</p>
            <p><strong>Submission Form:</strong> Records should be submitted via a designated form on the website that includes fields for: Record Title, Proposed Record Holder's Name, Date of Achievement, Detailed Description of the Record & Rules, Link or Upload for Evidence.</p>

            <p><strong>3. The Review Process</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The Review SCS:</strong> The SCS will review all submissions. Membership to the SCS will be passed down to the eldest descendant of each brother. If no descendants remain, the remaining SCS members will vote in someone to ensure there are at least 3 members.</p>
            <p><strong>Verification:</strong> The SCS will review the submitted evidence to ensure the record is valid and follows the rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Approval or Rejection:</strong> The SCS will either approve or reject the submission.</p>
            <p><strong>Approval:</strong> If approved, the record will be officially added to the "Stahl Book of World Records" on the website.</p>
            <p><strong>Rejection:</strong> If rejected, the SCS will provide a brief explanation for the decision (e.g., "Insufficient evidence," "Record is not unique").</p>
            <p><strong>Appeals Process:</strong> If a family member disagrees with the SCS's decision, they can resubmit the record with new or improved evidence. The SCS's final decision is binding.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Maintaining the Records</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Challenging a Record:</strong> Any family member can challenge an existing record. The challenger must submit their own evidence to the SCS, who will then review and update the record if a new "world record" has been set.</p>
