    <h2>Rules & History</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Since time immemorial, the Stahl family has been renowned for its competitive spirit and a deep-seated belief that every member possesses a unique, record-breaking talent. The founding of the Stahl Book of World Records (SBWR) was not a single event, but the culmination of decades worth of experiences starting with the eldest brother Matthew (b.1969), then Brian (b.1973), then Keith (b.1976).</p>
      <p>The three original "Founding Fathers" came to a consensus to establish the Supreme Council of the Stahls (SCS), acting as the sole arbiters of record claims, maintaining integrity, fairness, and worthiness.</p>
